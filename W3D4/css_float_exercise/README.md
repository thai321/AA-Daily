## CSS Float Exercise

Download this [skeleton][skeleton].

[skeleton]: ./skeleton.zip

Starting from the skeleton, update the the `flex.css` stylesheet. In this exercise, we will be updating our navbar to use the `float` property and create a basic fluid grid system for our main content. Let us begin. üôè

1. Instead of making the `nav` into an `inline-block` element, use `float` to put our `nav` in the top-right.
2. Just for fun, float the logo to the left and then clear-fix the vertical collapse problem.
3. Replace the fixed pixel widths of our `aside` and `main` content section with a fluid grid system similar to those seen in the [CSS Grid System video][css-grid-video]. Add all grid rules to `custom_grid.css`. Note that this will require updating `index.html` with respective container class names.
4. You may need to give your recipe image a width of `100%` so it expands to fit the entire `figure` and does not default to its natural fixed pixel width. Do this for all images by applying it to `css_custom_reset.css`.
