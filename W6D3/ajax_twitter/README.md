# AJAX Twitter

[**Live Demo!**][live-demo]

[live-demo]: https://aa-ajax-twitter.herokuapp.com

## Learning Goals

+ Know how AJAX requests allow the frontend and backend to communicate
+ Be able to change the backend of an app by sending an AJAX request
+ Be able to change the frontend of an app with data from an AJAX response
+ Be able to write AJAX requests in an API Util file
+ Be able to write basic JBuilder views
+ Know the basics of how promises work

## Phase 0: Setup

Download the project [skeleton](skeleton.zip?raw=true). Start by running `bundle
install`. To setup the database, run `rails db:setup` which creates, loads from
schema and seeds the db in one command. Run `webpack --watch` or `webpack -w` in a
new tab to transpile the JavaScript.

Take a quick look at the `webpack.config.js`. Note that our entry point is
`frontend/twitter.js`, so all of our other JavaScript files should be defined in
the `frontend` folder also. Webpack will transpile them from there and create a
`bundle.js` file in `app/assets/javascripts/`.

Next checkout `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`. This is Rails' manifest
file for JavaScript. All required JavaScript files are listed in the comment
block at the top. This works in a similar fashion to placing `<script>` tags in
our HTML, except that Rails compiles them all into a single file for production.
But unlike Webpack, Rails doesn't intelligently manage dependencies, so you still
have to be extra careful about the load order.

It's currently only requiring jQuery. Make it require `jquery.serializejson` (for submitting forms) and `bundle.js` (all the scripts!) as well. Now
we shouldn't have to worry about compiling our JS files again because Webpack
will do it for us as long as we remember to webpack (ie. run `webpack` or
`webpack --watch`).

Before writing any code, run `rails s` and familiarize yourself with the
skeleton!

## Phase I: `FollowToggle`

We will write a `FollowToggle` class that turns a button into a toggle that will
follow/unfollow a user.

First, let's modify the Rails view for the follow button to accommodate
front-end manipulation. Look at `app/views/follows/_form.html.erb`. Notice that
there are two branches of logic: the button will be a 'follow' button if the
current user is not yet following the user, and an 'unfollow' button if they
are. We want to replace the contents of this form with a single HTML element
that gets updated via our front-end JavaScript.

* Replace the contents of the button form with a single `<button>`.
* Give the button a class of `follow-toggle`.
* We'll also need to let the button know the `user-id` and `initial-follow-state`
("followed" or "unfollowed") by storing
these in [`data-*`][data-*] attributes.
* Leave the inner HTML of the button empty: the FollowToggle class will be
responsible for setting this.

[data-*]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*#Usage

#### `FollowToggle` Class

**NB:** Each of your JavaScript classes for this project should be in a separate
file in `frontend/`. Name the files in snake_case to match the casing of the rest
of the Rails app.

* Create a new file in `frontend/` called `follow_toggle.js`.

* Define the `constructor` for `FollowToggle`. In the `constructor`, extract the
`user-id` and `initial-follow-state` data from `el` and save them as `this.userId`
and `this.followState` for later use.
*  You might also find it convenient to store a jQuery wrapped `el` as an instance
variable.
* Set `module.exports` to your `FollowToggle` class to make it `require`-able.

Using this class, we can now build a `FollowToggle` instance for each
`follow-toggle` button on the page.

**NB:** Though the follow state is stored in the Rails API as a **_boolean_**, on the
client side, we'll keep track of the follow state as a **_string_**. This is
because later we'll add more states in addition to followed/unfollowed.

You'll probably want to start testing this out about now. But if you run Webpack
at this point, nothing will get transpiled because `twitter.js` (the entry point)
is empty, so let's fill it in.
+ Require your new `FollowToggle`class at the top,
and define a document ready callback below.
+ The callback should call your `constructor` once for each `button.follow-toggle` element.
+ You can use [jQuery#each][jquery-each] for this, but **beware**: the DOM element
is the _second_ callback argument; index comes first.

Once you're sure that your `FollowToggle` `constructor` is being called
correctly, write a `FollowToggle#render` method.
+ The text should be `"Follow!"` if `this.followState === "unfollowed"`,
+ The text should be `"Unfollow!"` if `this.followState === "followed"`.

Call your `#render` method inside the `constructor` to initially set the inner HTML.

Next, write a `FollowToggle#handleClick` method. Install this click handler in the
constructor. Your click handler should:
* Prevent the default action.
* Make a `$.ajax` request to `POST /users/:id/follow` if we are not following the
user (check `followState`), else, it should make a `DELETE` request.
* On success of the `POST`/`DELETE`, we should toggle the `followState` and
re-render.

**Hint**: You probably want to set the `dataType` option for `$.ajax`. This way
you can have jQuery automatically parse the response as JSON. Read the
documentation [here][$.ajax-docs]

#### Content-Types and `respond_to`

You may also be wondering what's going on with the `respond_to` inside the
`FollowsController`. Well, when we make an HTTP request to a server, we can
specify the `Content-Type` to ask for HTML, XML, JSON, text, etc. Until now, our
controllers were serving HTML by default.

The browser sets this `Content-Type` header for us based on how we make the
request. When we use the `$.ajax` method, we will (by default) request JSON. The
controller can then react to this `Content-Type` request by using the
[`respond_to` method][respond-to-docs].

[respond-to-docs]: http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/MimeResponds/InstanceMethods/respond_to
[$.ajax-docs]: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/

Check to make sure this works!

#### API Util

Let's refactor our AJAX calls into an `api_util` file. Your API util should export
an object with the methods `APIUtil#followUser(id)` and `APIUtil#unfollowUser(id)`

```js
const APIUtil = {
  followUser: id => {
    // ...
  },

  unfollowUser: id => {
    // ...
  }
}

module.exports = APIUtil;
```

Use a promise to chain a success callback onto your API call that changes the
`followState` appropriately and re-renders.

Lastly, let's freeze-out the button so that people can't click it while the AJAX
request is pending.
* In `handleClick` set `followState` to `following` or `unfollowing` and call `#render`.
* Update your `#render` method to set the `disabled` property if the `followState`
is `following` or `unfollowing`;
* Otherwise, make sure `disabled` is set to false. (Use jQuery's `#prop` method).

**Check that everything works and call over your TA so that they can check your work!**

[jquery-each]: https://api.jquery.com/each

## Phase II: `UsersSearch`

Review `app/controllers/users_controller.rb` and
`app/views/users/search.html.erb`. We want to create real-time user search. On
every keypress as the user types in a username, we'll show the matching users
for the current input.

#### `UsersSearch` Class

* Replace the entire form with a `nav` with class `users-search`.
* Add an input field for the user to type the name.
* Nested in the `nav.users-search`, have a `ul.users` for displaying results.
* Create a `frontend/users_search.js` file and define the `UsersSearch` class.
* As with `FollowToggle`, build a `UsersSearch` for each `nav.users-search` in
your entry file.
* In the constructor, store jQuery wrapped versions of the `el`, its `input` and
its `ul` on `this`.
* Write an `APIUtil#searchUsers(queryVal, success)` to make a request to
`/users/search`.
You can send query parameters along with an `$.ajax` call through the `data`.
Don't forget to set `dataType`!
* Write a `UsersSearch#handleInput` handler. On each `input` event, call
`APIUtil.searchUsers`, sending the input's `val` as the query parameter.

#### Users Controller

Now, let's set up your controller to respond to AJAX requests with JSON. Because
your controller will be handling both HTML and JSON requests, let's separate out
each of those types of requests and respond to them separately. Put the
following code into your controller to replace the line reading `render
:search`:

```ruby
respond_to do |format|
  format.html { render :search }
  format.json { render :search }
end
```

#### Jbuilder Teaser

We've told the controller to render the `:search` HTML view for requests that
want HTML and to render the `:search` JSON view for requests that want JSON. But
we don't yet have a `search.json` view! Let's make one. The file, in the
`/users/` folder, should be named `search.json.jbuilder` and should contain the
following code:

```ruby
json.array!(@users) do |user|
  json.(user, *User.column_names)
  json.followed(current_user.follows?(user))
end
```

**NB**: Take some time to learn a little bit about [Jbuilder][jbuilder], a very
useful gem that allow us to write Ruby that create JSON views. We'll learn about
and use it much more next week. For now, just follow along!

The code above takes your `@users` instance variable and turns it into an array
of JSON objects. Each object will have all of its information as well as
`followed`, which will be either true or false depending on whether the current
user is following this user.

#### Handling Success

When the AJAX call successfully returns a list of matching users, we want to
display those results in the `ul.users`.
Write a method `UsersSearch#renderResults` for your promise success handler. It
should:
* Empty out `ul.users` and iterate through the fetched array of users.
* For each result, use jQuery to build an `li` containing an anchor tag linking to
the user.
* Use the jQuery `append` method to add each result to the `ul`.

**Test your code**: Check that you can now interactively search users.

#### Adding FollowToggle to Search Results

Last, we want to add follow toggle buttons for each of these results. When
building the `li` tags for each user, build a `button`, too. You can create a
FollowToggle instance for the button to setup the follow toggle.

**NB:** Inspect the JSON objects that you are getting from the server to see
 whether or not they are currently being followed.

You could make this work by setting data attributes on the button for `user-id`
and `initial-follow-state`. In this context, that's kind of annoying. Instead,
it is common to allow jQuery plugins to take options. I modified my
`FollowToggle` like so:

```js
class FollowToggle {
  constructor(el, options) {
    this.$el = $(el);
    this.userId = this.$el.data("user-id") || options.userId;
    this.followState = (this.$el.data("initial-follow-state") ||
                        options.followState);
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Phase III: `TweetCompose`

First, we're going to update our `TweetsController` to handle JSON requests,
similarly to how we updated our `UsersController` before. If we've successfully
created a tweet from a JSON request, then we should render that tweet back as
JSON. We could `render json: @tweet`, but then we might not have all of the
information we need. Add a `respond_to` block and put cases for `format.html`
and `format.json` inside it. If the request matches `format.json`, call `render
:show` so that we can structure our response to our application's needs.

Now, just as we did before, let's create a show view for our tweets. We're going
to call a partial in this view; to that end, we'll put the following code in
`show.json.jbuilder`:

```ruby
json.partial!("tweets/tweet", tweet: @tweet)
```

Partials in Jbuilder work the same way they do in ERB - the partial file name
starts with a `_` and you pass in a piece of information for the partial to
render using a hash. Let's create that partial right now at
`_tweet.json.jbuilder` and put the following code into it:

```ruby
json.(tweet, *Tweet.column_names)

json.user(tweet.user, *User.column_names)

json.mentions(tweet.mentions) do |mention|
  json.(mention, *Mention.column_names)
  json.user(mention.user, *User.column_names)
end
```

What this code is doing is collecting the tweet's information, the tweeter's
information, and also information about each of that tweet's mentions.

#### `TweetCompose` Class

* Open `app/views/tweets/_form.html.erb` and give the form a class `tweet-compose`.
* Write a TweetCompose class that grabs this form and installs itself.
* In the `TweetCompose` `constructor`, install a `submit` event handler.
* Write a `TweetCompose#submit` method that uses `serializeJSON` to build JSON
from the form contents and write an `APIUtil#createTweet(data)` function to submit
the form.

As before, disable the form when the submit is made. You can't disable an entire
form, so you'll have to disable all the inputs. To get all the inputs, use
jQuery's [`:input` pseudo-CSS selector][input-selector]. Make sure not to
disable your inputs until after you've serialized the form contents, or their
values will be ignored. :(

[input-selector]: http://api.jquery.com/input-selector

Write a `TweetCompose#clearInput` method to empty out all the inputs after a
tweet is successfully created. Write a `TweetCompose#handleSuccess` method. This
should call `clearInput` and re-enable the form.

In `#handleSuccess`, we also want to insert the created tweet into the list of
all tweets. How does `TweetCompose` find the `ul` of tweets? We can set a data
attribute on the form where the value is the selector that corresponds to the
target `ul`. For example, if we give the target `ul` an id of `#feed`, we can
give our form the following data attribute: `data-tweets-ul="#feed"`. Our
`TweetCompose` can pull out this data attribute and use the selector `#feed` to
find the `ul`. This is better than hard coding `#feed` into the JS.

A successful AJAX post request for a tweet should return back the newly created
tweet in JSON format. For simplicity, have `TweetCompose` call `JSON.stringify`
on the created Tweet. Build an `li` with the JSON content, and stick it in the
`ul`. We'll actually render this nicely in a later phase.

#### Maximum characters

Finally, let's add a counter that will show the number of characters remaining
for a tweet (starting at 140). Add a `strong` tag with class `.chars-left` to
the form. In the `TweetCompose` `constructor`, add an `input` event handler on the
`textarea`. In it, update the `strong` tag with the number of characters remaining.

**Call your TA over to check your work!**

## Phase IV: `TweetCompose`: Mentioned Users

The next part is to allow us to tag multiple users in a tweet. Right now we can
select a single user to tag. Our killer feature will be to dynamically create
more select tags so we can tag more users.

#### Adding mentions

Rather than have just one select tag visible all the time, we want to have no
select tags to start. Instead, we want to show an "Add mention" link which will
let us add multiple select tags to the page.

To do this, first move the `select` tag into a `<script type="text/template">`
tag. This tells the browser not to put the `select` in the DOM. If you reload,
you should see no select tag.

Write an "Add mention" anchor tag. Give it a placeholder `href`.
`href="#"` is fine, but make sure to return `false` from the event handler to
prevent being scrolled to the top of the page. Also give it a class
`add-mentioned-user`. I also added a `div.mentioned-users` that will house all
these newly generated select tags.

* In the `TweetCompose` `constructor`, add a listener for a click on
`a.add-mentioned-user`.
* Write a `TweetCompose#addMentionedUser` method.
* Use jQuery to find the `script` tag, grab the HTML from within using
`$scriptTag.html()`, then append it into the `mentioned-users` div.
* Don't forget to return false from `addMentionedUser`!

Test this out and make sure you can create new `select` tags by clicking the link.

#### Removing mentions

Next, I also want to be able to **remove** select tags. Say we clicked "add"
accidentally and want to remove the `select`.
* To do this, modify the script template by putting the `select` in a `div`.
* Write an anchor tag inside with class `remove-mentioned-user`.
* Give it a similar bogus `href` attribute.

* In the `TweetCompose` `constructor`, listen for `click` events on
`a.remove-mentioned-user`. **You have to use event delegation here: why?**
* Write a `TweetCompose#removeMentionedUser` and use `event.currentTarget`
to learn which remove anchor tag was clicked, and removed the parent `div`
element. This removes both the anchor tag and the select, too.

Make sure it works!

Lastly, we want to update `TweetCompose#clearInput` to clear out all the selects
after form submission succeeds.
* Put all your select tags into a div with class `.mentioned-users`.
* In `#clearInput`, grab this div and `empty()` it.

## Phase V: Infinite Tweets

Right now we send all the tweets down when the user requests `/feed`. If there
are many, many tweets in the feed, this will send a huge amount of data to the
user. Moreover, the user is likely to be interested in only the most recent
tweets.

#### User Model

Let's **paginate** the sending of tweets. To start, open up
`app/models/user.rb`. Modify the `#feed_tweets` method to send only up to
`limit` tweets. Also, modify it not to return any tweets created after
`max_created_at`. Test this out in your Rails console before moving to the
JavaScript portion.

#### Views

Next, let's begin modifying the `app/views/feeds/show.html.erb` template. You
should have a `ul#feed` from phase III. Wrap that `ul` with a `div` with class
`infinite-tweets`. You can empty out the contents of the `ul#feed` since we'll
be adding the tweets inside dynamically with jQuery now. Also, write an anchor
tag with class `fetch-more`; this link will be clicked to load more tweets.

#### Feeds Controller

As we did before, we're going to have to update our FeedsController to handle JSON
requests. Replace the `render :show` line in `FeedsController#show` with the
following code:

```ruby
respond_to do |format|
  format.html { render :show }
  format.json { render :show }
end
```

Now, also in a repetition of our earlier process, let's build out the rest of
our JSON API. We'll start by creating a `feeds/show.json.jbuilder`. We can reuse
the tweet partial we already wrote by calling it in this show view:

```ruby
json.array!(@feed_tweets) do |tweet|
  json.partial!("tweets/tweet", tweet: tweet)
end
```

#### `InfiniteTweets` Class

Begin writing an `InfiniteTweets` class.
* Listen for clicks to fetch more;
* Create an `InfiniteTweets#fetchTweets` method.
* Create an `APIUtil` method to make requests to `/feed`
* In `#fetchTweets`, call your `APIUtil`, and on resolution of the promise call an
`#insertTweets` method.
* For simplicity, for each tweet, just append `<li>` items with
`JSON.stringify(tweet)` into the appropriate `ul`.


If you click the link twice, you'll fetch the same set of tweets twice. We need
to send the `max_created_at` parameter.
* In the `InfiniteTweets` `constructor`, initialize `this.maxCreatedAt` to `null`.
* In the `#fetchTweets` method, if `maxCreatedAt !== null`, send it in the AJAX
`data` parameter. (Notice the often confusing mix of Ruby and JS naming
conventions).
* When successfully fetching tweets, record `this.max_created_at` by looking at the
`created_at` attribute of the last tweet fetched. This should ensure that each
call to `#fetchTweets` fetches the next set of tweets, chronologically.

Once you've fetched all the tweets, you should remove the "Fetch more tweets"
link and replace it with a message that there are no more tweets to fetch. You
can tell there are no more tweets to fetch if `< 20` tweets are returned.

## Phase VI: jQuery Triggering

There is one last step. Your `TweetCompose` also tries to insert tweets into the
feed. Should we copy over all the logic of `InfiniteTweets` into `TweetCompose`?
That doesn't sound very DRY.

Instead of having `TweetCompose` insert HTML into the DOM, have it
`jQuery#trigger` an `insert-tweet` event on your `#feed` ul. This is a **custom
event** (not a pre-defined browser event) that you can use so that one module of
code can signal another module. Here, this allows `TweetCompose` to remain
agnostic of how a new tweet is inserted; by triggering the custom event,
`TweetCompose` simply notifies `InfiniteTweets` to do the work of insertion.

* Add a listener for `insert-tweet` in the `InfiniteTweets` class and have it fire
an `InfiniteTweets#insertTweet` method.
* When you trigger the event from the `TweetCompose` class, pass the newly created
tweet's data along as well.

**Common bug**: You may also want `insertTweet` to update the the `lastCreatedAt`
instance variable. If you were to compose a tweet and not set `lastCreatedAt`,
you'll fetch the same tweet again when you make an AJAX call to `/feed`.

## Phase VII: Jbuilder Practice

Since we're going to be using Jbuilder often over the next few weeks, let's
get some more practice with it today. Use its [docs][jbuilder] a guide.

#### Follows Show

Let's start by creating a simple view for
our FollowsController to use. In both its `create` and `destroy` methods, the
FollowsController calls `render json: @follow`. Replace that with `render :show`
and write a `show` view in Jbuilder. This view should have the same effect as
calling `render json: @follow` - all of the follow's information should get sent
to the frontend.

Test your new view by creating and destroying `Follows` using your app. Does it
still work?

#### Users Show

Next, we'll work on a `show` view for users. In a full Rails API backend, we
might use this view when a user is created, destroyed, or shown, as well as
whenever a user logs in or out. This view should be similar to the view we just
wrote, with one crucial difference: we need to keep our users' private
information from being sent over the internet. Write a
`users/show.json.jbuilder` that only returns a user's `username` and `id`,
keeping their `password_digest` and `session_token` safe on the server.

Test your new view by modifying your `User#create` method to `render :show` when
it receives a JSON request. Does your view send back the correct information if
you test it using Postman? After your test succeeds, change your controller code
back.

#### Tweets Index

Finally, we'll write an `index` view for tweets. This view isn't strictly
applicable to our current application, but it demonstrates a pattern that you
will use in future full-stack applications, particularly when we start using
Redux. We're going to return an object filled with tweets, each tweet keyed by
its id. It will look like the following:

```js
{
  "1": {
    "content": "Set world napping record",
    "user_id": 1
  },
  "2": {
    "content": "Jumped to the top of the shelf!",
    "user_id": 1
  },
}
```

Write a `tweets/index.json.jbuilder` that returns an object full of tweets.
Create a `Tweets#index` method and route, and render your new index view in it.
Test your new code by navigating to `localhost:3000/tweets`.

Next, include the tweeter's username along with each tweet. Prevent n+1 queries
by using `includes`. Check your server log and make sure that only two queries
are being fired to display all of the tweets and usernames.

Next, include a list of each tweet's mentioned users along with each tweet. Make
sure to add `:mentioned_users` to your `includes` statement to prevent n+1
queries. Test your new code by navigating to `localhost:3000/tweets` - your
returned JSON should look like this:

```js
{
  "1": {
    "content": "Set world napping record",
    "user_id": 1,
    "username": "breakfast",
    "mentioned_users": []
  },
  "2": {
    "content": "Jumped to the top of the shelf!",
    "user_id": 1,
    "username": "breakfast",
    "mentioned_users": []
  },
}
```

## Phase VIII: CSS

Take a look at the live Twitter website. See how close you can get your app to
look like it.

Pick a nice font from [Google fonts][g-fonts]. Add it to the head of your
`layouts/application.html.erb` view. Make an `index.css` file in
`app/assets/stylesheets` for all of your CSS to go in. As long as your CSS files
are in this folder, Rails will automatically load them.

Start with the page layout. Have the main section contain the feed and a sidebar
contain everything else. Use a flexbox to get everything to line up.

Style the feed next. Add borders and any other flourishes you'd like to make each
tweet visually distinct from the next.

After your main layout and feed look nice, style the user search page. Space out
the results. Feel free to style the button, too!

Style the login page and signup page. These can look very similar, so think about
how you can reuse classes to produce a standard, repeated aesthetic for the site.
