## How to Prepare

Know authentication!

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of topics that may be covered:

* Authentication
* Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in ruby on rails.
* Lather, rinse, repeat the practice assessment and learn how to read the [Capybara][capybara] specs.

There are two practice assessments in this repo. The first, in the
skeleton and solution folders, is the main practice assessment. Focus on
this one to start. Treat it as you would any other practice assessment.
The second, in the `debug_version` [folder][buggy], is a solved version
of that same practice assessment, but with a solution full of bugs. The
goal of this buggy assessment is for you to become familiar with the wide range of
bugs you might see in the course of the real assessment. There's no need to
time yourself on this one or even to work through it all the way. It's there
as extra practice. Feel free to compare with the regular A04 Practice solution
if you get stuck.
