# Building ActiveRecordLite

In this project, we build our own lite version of ActiveRecord.

## Learning Goals

* Know when to write class methods and when to write instance methods
* Know how to use `define_method` inside a class method to add instance methods
* Be able to create a generic SQLObject class that abstracts table-specific
logic away
* Understand how ActiveRecord interfaces with the database
* Be able to write generic query methods that any class inheriting from
SQLObject can use (e.g., `all`, `where`)

## Setup

Download the [skeleton][skeleton].

[skeleton]: ../skeleton.zip?raw=true

There are specs in it which will guide you through the project. Because
they're using a database, they run a little slow, so it might be helpful
to run them one file at a time:

```
$ rspec spec/01_sql_object_spec.rb
```

To aid in debugging, we've also coded an option into the skeleton so you
can print all the queries and interpolation arguments that get sent to
the SQL engine. To enable this, pass `PRINT_QUERIES=true` as an ENV
variable when you run the `rspec` command.

```
$ PRINT_QUERIES=true rspec spec/01_sql_object_spec.rb
```

## Phase 0: Implement `my_attr_accessor`

This phase will serve as a (relatively) easy warm up to
metaprogramming. You already know what the standard Ruby method
`attr_accessor` does. What if Ruby didn't provide this convenient
method for you?

In the `lib/00_attr_accessor_object.rb` file, implement a
`::my_attr_accessor` macro, which should do exactly the same thing as
the real `attr_accessor`: it should define setter/getter methods.

To do this, use `define_method` inside `::my_attr_accessor` to define
getter and setter instance methods. You'll want to investigate and use
the `instance_variable_get` and `instance_variable_set` methods
described [here][ivar-get].

[ivar-get]: http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Object.html#method-i-instance_variable_get

There is a corresponding `spec/00_attr_accessor_object_spec.rb` spec
file. Run it using `bundle exec rspec` to check your work.

## Phase I: `SQLObject`: Overview

Our job is to write a class, `SQLObject`, that will interact with the
database. By the **end** of this phase, our ActiveRecord Lite will behave
just like the real `ActiveRecord::Base`, with methods including:

* `::all`: return an array of all the records in the DB
* `::find`: look up a single record by primary key
* `#insert`: insert a new row into the table to represent the
  `SQLObject`.
* `#update`: update the row with the `id` of this `SQLObject`
* `#save`: convenience method that either calls `insert`/`update`
  depending on whether or not the `SQLObject` already exists in the table.

## Phase Ia: `::table_name` and `::table_name=`

Before we begin writing methods that interact with the DB, we need to
be able to figure out which table the records should be fetched from,
inserted into, etc. We should write a class getter method
`::table_name` which will get the name of the table for the class. We
should also write a `::table_name=` setter to set the table. Since our
`SQLObject` class is itself an object (an instance of `Class`), we can
store that as a instance variable on the class *#everythingisanobject*.

**NB:** I know you're itching to exercise your newly-acquired
metaprogramming chops, but there's no need to use fancy methods like
`#instance_variable_get`/`_set` for this step when a simple, normal
instance variable will do. Never make things more complicated than they
need to be. This is a great rule for programming, and for life.

Example:

```ruby
class Human < SQLObject
  self.table_name = "humans"
end

Human.table_name # => "humans"
```

It would also be nice if, in the absence of an explicitly set table
name, we would have `::table_name` by default convert the class name
to snake\_case and pluralize:

```ruby
class BigDog < SQLObject
end

BigDog.table_name # => "big_dogs"
```

ActiveSupport (part of Rails) has an inflector library that adds
methods to `String` to help you do this. In particular, look at the
`String#tableize` method. You can require
the inflector with `require 'active_support/inflector'`.

**NB**: you cannot always infer the name of the table. For example:
the `inflector` library will, by default, pluralize `human` into
`humen`, not `humans`. [WAT][wat]. That's what your `::table_name=` is
for: so users of `SQLObject` can override the default, inferred table
name.

Make sure the `::table_name` specs in `spec/01_sql_object_spec` are
working and move onward!

## Phase Ib: Listing Columns

In our sample database, the `cats` table has `id`, `name`, and
`owner_id` columns. When we define a model class `Cat < SQLObject`, it
should automatically have setter and getter methods for each of the
columns. For instance, we want to be able to write:

```ruby
class Cat < SQLObject
  # We'll explain finalize! later!
  self.finalize!
end

c = Cat.new
c.name = "Gizmo"
c.owner_id = 123

c.name #=> "Gizmo"
c.owner_id #=> 123
```

We'll get there eventually, but let's start by writing a `SQLObject`
**class method** `::columns`, which should return an array with the
names of the table's columns.  We want `Cat.columns == [:id, :name,
:owner_id]`. To do this, we can query the database using
`DBConnection.execute2` to ask it what the columns are for a table.
Let's see how we might do this:

```ruby
DBConnection.execute2(<<-SQL)
  SELECT
    *
  FROM
    cats
SQL
# => [
#   ["id", "name", "owner_id"],
#   {"id"=>1, "name"=>"Breakfast", "owner_id"=>1},
#   {"id"=>2, "name"=>"Earl", "owner_id"=>2},
#   {"id"=>3, "name"=>"Haskell", "owner_id"=>3},
#   {"id"=>4, "name"=>"Markov", "owner_id"=>3}
# ]
```

The `DBConnection::execute2` method returns an array; the first element
is a list of the names of columns, while the rest of the items represent
individual records in the DB. (**Note:** We're using `execute2` to
easily retrieve the column names. You'll want to stick with the
regular `execute` method for all other queries.)

Now that you've seen how to use `DBConnection::execute2`, write a
`::columns` method which queries the DB (interpolating the class's
`::table_name`), and returns the array of columns as **symbols**.
Remember that DB queries are expensive, so we only want to make the
query **once**, regardless of how often `::columns` gets called.

Note: the `execute` and `execute2` methods **will not allow us to interpolate into the `FROM` statement.**

```ruby
DBConnection.execute(<<-SQL, cats)
  SELECT
    *
  FROM
    ?
SQL
```

The above will not work. Use standard string interpolation instead: `#{}`.

## Phase Ic: Getters and Setters

Now that we can list columns, we'll write a class method `::finalize!`
that automatically adds getter and setter methods for each column.
Here is how it's intended to be used:

```ruby
class Cat < SQLObject
  # Finalize is called at the end of the subclass definition to
  # add the getters/setters.
  self.finalize!
end

cat = Cat.new
cat.name = "Gizmo"
cat.name #=> "Gizmo"
```

### `#attributes`

When we say `cat.name = "Gizmo"`, how should we store the value "Gizmo"?
We *could* save it in an instance variable that we dynamically call
`@name` just like we did with `my_attr_accessor`, but then we wouldn't
know which instance variables are associated with columns and which
aren't. Remember that `ActiveRecord::Base` gives us a handy method
`#attributes` that hands us a hash of all our model's columns and
values.

Let's define `#attributes` in `SQLObject`. It should lazily initialize
`@attributes` to an empty hash in case it doesn't exist yet. After we
set up the `::finalize!` method properly, it should work like so:

```ruby
cat = Cat.new
cat.attributes #=> {}
cat.name = "Gizmo"
cat.attributes #=> { name: "Gizmo" }
```

### `::finalize!`

Now we can finally write `::finalize!`. It should iterate through all
the `::columns`, using `define_method` (twice) to create a getter and
setter method for each column, just like `my_attr_accessor`. But *this*
time, instead of dynamically creating an instance variable, store
everything in the `#attributes` hash.

**NB**: it's important that the user of `SQLObject` call `finalize!`
at the end of their subclass definition, otherwise the getter/setter
methods don't get defined. That's hacky, but it will have to do. :-)

Make sure the `::columns` and setter/getter specs now pass.

## Phase Id: `#initialize`

Write an `#initialize` method for `SQLObject`. It should take in a
single `params` hash. We want:

```ruby
cat = Cat.new(name: "Gizmo", owner_id: 123)
cat.name #=> "Gizmo"
cat.owner_id #=> 123
```

Your `#initialize` method should iterate through each of the `attr_name,
value` pairs. For each `attr_name`, it should first convert the name to
a symbol, and then check whether the `attr_name` is among the `columns`.
If it is not, raise an error:

    unknown attribute '#{attr_name}'

Set the attribute by calling the setter method. Use `#send`; avoid
using `@attributes` or `#attributes` inside `#initialize`.

**Hint**: we need to call `::columns` on a class object, not the
instance. For example, we can call `Dog::columns` but not
`dog.columns`.

Note that `dog.class == Dog`. How can we use the `Object#class` method
to access the `::columns` **class method** from inside the
`#initialize` **instance method**?

Run the specs, Luke!

## Phase Ie: `::all`, `::parse_all`

We now want to write a method `::all` that will fetch all the records
from the database. The first thing to do is to try to generate the
necessary SQL query to issue. Generate SQL and print it out so you can
view and verify it. Use the heredoc syntax to define your query.

Example:

```ruby
class Cat < SQLObject
  finalize!
end

Cat.all
# SELECT
#   cats.*
# FROM
#   cats

class Human < SQLObject
  self.table_name = "humans"

  finalize!
end

Human.all
# SELECT
#   humans.*
# FROM
#   humans
```

Notice that the SQL is formulaic except for the table name, which we
need to insert. Use ordinary Ruby string interpolation (`#{whatevs}`) for
this; SQL will only let you use `?` to interpolate **values**, not
table or column names.

Once we've got our query looking good, it's time to execute it. Use
the provided `DBConnection` class. You can use
`DBConnection.execute(<<-SQL, arg1, arg2, ...)` in the usual manner.

Calling `DBConnection` will return an array of raw `Hash` objects
where the keys are column names and the values are column values. We
want to turn these into Ruby objects:

```ruby
class Human < SQLObject
  self.table_name = "humans"

  finalize!
end

Human.all
=> [#<Human:0x007fa409ceee38
  @attributes={:id=>1, :fname=>"Devon", :lname=>"Watts", :house_id=>1}>,
 #<Human:0x007fa409cee988
  @attributes={:id=>2, :fname=>"Matt", :lname=>"Rubens", :house_id=>1}>,
 #<Human:0x007fa409cee528
  @attributes={:id=>3, :fname=>"Ned", :lname=>"Ruggeri", :house_id=>2}>]
```

To turn each of the `Hash`es into `Human`s, write a
`SQLObject::parse_all` method. Iterate through the results, using
`new` to create a new instance for each.

`new` what? `SQLObject.new`? That's not right, we want `Human.all` to
return `Human` objects, and `Cat.all` to return `Cat`
objects. **Hint**: inside the `::parse_all` class method, what is
`self`?

Now we can call `::parse_all` from inside `::all` and make all the specs pass!

## Phase If: `::find`

Write a `SQLObject::find(id)` method to return a single object with
the given id. You could write `::find` using `::all` and `Array#find`
like so:

```ruby
class SQLObject
  def self.find(id)
    self.all.find { |obj| obj.id == id }
  end
end
```

That would be inefficient: we'd fetch all the records from the DB.
Instead, write a new SQL query that will fetch at most one record.

Yo dawg, I heard you like specs, so I spent a lot of time writing
them. Please run them again. :-)

## Phase Ig: `#insert`

Write a `SQLObject#insert` instance method. It should build and
execute a SQL query like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO
  table_name (col1, col2, col3)
VALUES
  (?, ?, ?)
```

To simplify building this query, I made two local variables:

* `col_names`: I took the array of `::columns` of the class and
  joined it with commas.
* `question_marks`: I built an array of question marks (`["?"] * n`)
  and joined it with commas. What determines the number of question marks?

Lastly, when you call `DBConnection.execute`, you'll need to pass in
the values of the columns. Two hints:

* I wrote a `SQLObject#attribute_values` method that returns an array
  of the values for each attribute. I did this by calling `Array#map`
  on `SQLObject::columns`, calling `send` on the instance to get
  the value.
* Once you have the `#attribute_values` method working, I passed this
  into `DBConnection.execute` using the splat operator.

When the DB inserts the record, it will assign the record an ID.
After the `INSERT` query is run, we want to update our `SQLObject`
instance with the assigned ID. Check out the `DBConnection` file for a
helpful method.

Again with the specs please.

## Phase Ih: `#update`

Next we'll write a `SQLObject#update` method to update a record's
attributes. Here's a reminder of what the resulting SQL should look
like:

```sql
UPDATE
  table_name
SET
  col1 = ?, col2 = ?, col3 = ?
WHERE
  id = ?
```

This is very similar to the `#insert` method. To produce the
"SET line", I mapped `::columns` to `#{attr_name} = ?` and joined with
commas.

I again used the `#attribute_values` trick. I additionally passed in
the `id` of the object (for the last `?` in the `WHERE` clause).

Every day I'm testing.

## Phase Ii: `#save`

Finally, write an instance method `SQLObject#save`. This should call
`#insert` or `#update` depending on whether `id.nil?`. It is not
intended that the user call `#insert` or `#update` directly (leave
them public so the specs can call them :-)).

You did it! Good work!

## Phase II: `Searchable`

Let's write a module named `Searchable` which will add the ability to
search using `::where`. By using `extend`, we can mix in `Searchable`
to our `SQLObject` class, adding all the module methods as class
methods.

So let's write `Searchable#where(params)`. Here's an example:

```ruby
haskell_cats = Cat.where(:name => "Haskell", :color => "calico")
# SELECT
#   *
# FROM
#   cats
# WHERE
#   name = ? AND color = ?
```

I used a local variable `where_line` where I mapped the `keys` of the
`params` to `"#{key} = ?"` and joined with `AND`.

To fill in the question marks, I used the `values` of the `params`
object.
