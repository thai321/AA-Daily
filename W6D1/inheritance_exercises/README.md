# Inheritance Exercises

## Learning Goals

+ Be able to write and explain `Function.prototype.inherits`
  + Know what a `Surrogate` class does and why we need it
  + Know what the `constructor` property does
  + Know what `__proto__` is
  + Know what `new` does
  + Know what `Object.create` does
+ Know how to test an inheritance implementation

### `inherits`

We've learned a couple of ways to implement class inheritance in Javascript.
Let's first look at using a `Surrogate`.

There are a number of steps:

* Define a `Surrogate` class
* Set the prototype of the `Surrogate` (`Surrogate.prototype =
  SuperClass.prototype`)
* Set `Subclass.prototype = new Surrogate()`
* Set `Subclass.prototype.constructor = Subclass`

Write a `Function.prototype.inherits` method that will do this for you.
Do not use `Object.create` right now; you should deeply understand what
the `new` keyword does and how the `__proto__` chain is constructed. This
will help you in Asteroids today:

```javascript
function MovingObject () {}

function Ship () {}
Ship.inherits(MovingObject);

function Asteroid () {}
Asteroid.inherits(MovingObject);
```

How would you test `Function.prototype.inherits`? A few specs to consider:

* You should be able to define methods/attributes on `MovingObject`
   that ship and asteroid instances can use.
* Defining a method on `Asteroid`'s prototype should not mean that a
   ship can call it.
* Adding to `Ship` or `Asteroid`'s prototypes should not change
   `MovingObject`'s prototype.
* The `Ship` and `Asteroid` prototypes should not be instances of
   `MovingObject`.

After you have written `Function.prototype.inherits` using the surrogate trick,
refactor your solution using `Object.create`. Make sure to test that your
updated solution works.

And finally, take a look at [our answers][inherits-answer]. Make sure you thoroughly
understand what both solutions do. You'll be writing an `inherits` method again
for Asteroids.
