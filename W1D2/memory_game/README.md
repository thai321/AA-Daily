# Memory Puzzle

Today we're going to implement a simple command-line version of the
classic [Match 2 memory card game][match-memory].

## Learning Goals

* Understand how classes interact in an object-oriented program
* Be able to use `require_relative`
* Be able to write the methods `[]` and `[]=` and explain how they work
* Develop a workflow that uses pry to test small parts of your code
* Know how to initialize an Array with a default value
* Know how to use duck typing to allow different classes to interact with your
program

Write classes for Card, Board, and Game. Please put each class in its own file
and use `require_relative` to include other files in your program.

## Card

A Card has two useful bits of information: its face value, and whether
it is face-up or face-down. You'll want instance variables to keep track
of this information. You'll also want a method to display information
about the card: nothing when face-down, or its value when face-up. I
also wrote `#hide`, `#reveal`, `#to_s`, and `#==` methods.

Common problem: Having issues with `#hide` and `#reveal`? See
[here][testing-small].

## Board

The Board is responsible for keeping track of all your Cards. You'll
want a grid instance variable to contain Cards. Useful
methods:

- `#populate` should fill the board with a set of shuffled Card pairs
- `#render` should print out a representation of the Board's current
  state
- `#won?` should return true if all cards have been revealed.
- `#reveal` should reveal a Card at `guessed_pos` (unless it's already
  face-up, in which case the method should do nothing). It should also
  return the value of the card it revealed (you'll see why later).

#### Parallel Assignment

In Ruby you can declare and assign multiple variables at once using commas to
separate multiple variables and values. For example,
```rb
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3 # x = 1, y = 2, z = 3
```
And if there's not the same number of variables and values?
```rb
x, y = 1, 2, 3 # x = 1, y = 2, 3 is not assigned
a, b, c = 10, 20 # a = 10, b = 20, c = nil
```
When there are multiple variables assigned to an array, Ruby expands the array
so that each element becomes its own value! For example,
```rb
x, y, z = [1, 2, 3] # x = 1, y = 2, z = 3
a, b, c = [10, 20] # a = 10, b = 20, c = nil
```
This is very helpful to use when writing `[](pos)` and `[]=(pos, value)` for
your Board to access `row` and `col`. Because the `pos` exists as an array,
it's better to pass it as an array in a method call, relying on the method to
index the array.

## Game

The Game should have instance variable for the Board and the
previously-guessed position (if any). It should also have methods for
managing the Board-Player interaction. You may want a `play` loop that
runs until the game is `over`. Inside the loop, you should `render` the
board, `prompt` the player for input, and get a guessed `pos`. Pass this
`pos` to a `make_guess` method, where you will handle the actual
memory/matching logic. Some tips on implementing this:

- If we're not already checking another Card, leave the card at
  `guessed_pos` face-up and update the `previous_guess` variable.
- If we **are** checking another card, we should compare the Card at
  `guessed_pos` with the one at `previous_guess`.
  - If the cards match, we should leave them both face-up.
  - Else, flip both cards face-down.
  - In either case, reset `previous_guess`.

It wouldn't be an interesting game if the player could see their previous moves.
Run `system("clear")` before `render`ing the Board. This will hide any previous
output from the player. `sleep(n)` will pause the program for `n` seconds. Use
this method to (temporarily) show the player an incorrect guess before flipping
the Cards face-down again.

## AI

#### Refactor game to include a HumanPlayer class

Before actually implementing the computer player, let's make things easier on
ourselves and refactor the game to accept player classes. In order to accomplish
this, move all of your user input logic into the player class. I moved the
following methods out of the Game class into the player:
- `prompt`
- `get_input`

Before moving on, make sure your game runs successfully with a `HumanPlayer`.

#### Create a ComputerPlayer class

The computer player's strategy should be as follows:
- On its first guess, if it knows where 2 matching cards are, guess one of them,
otherwise guess randomly among cards it has not yet seen.
- On its second guess, if its first guess revealed a card whose value matches a
known location, guess that location, otherwise guess randomly among cards it has
not yet seen.

Now comes the tricky part. With the HumanPlayer, we didn't need to explicitly
receive the data from the card we're flipping over; we just read it off the
terminal output. The computer won't be quite so savvy. Let's write some methods
to have it accept the revealed card information from the game:
- `receive_revealed_card` should take in a position and the value of
the card revealed at that location. It should then store it in a `@known_cards`
hash.
- `receive_match` should take in two positions which are a successful match. I
stored these in an instance variable `@matched_cards`

The game should then call these methods on the player in addition to displaying
the revealed cards to the terminal.

**NB:** The game shouldn't have to know
whether a human or computer is playing. Instead, it should use [duck
typing](http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/duck_typing.html). This may involve
writing some "dummy" methods on the `HumanPlayer` class. That's ok.

## Bonus

**Come back to this after you finish Sudoku!**

- Implement a simple command-line interface, allowing the user to
  determine the difficulty of the game (i.e., the size of the board).
  Do this **before** the Game is `initialize`d. Remember `if __FILE__ ==
  $PROGRAM_NAME`!
- Enforce an upper limit on the number of turns played. If the limit is
  exceeded, the player loses.
- Let's add a twist: start the game by placing a certain number of
  "bombs" instead of normal cards. When the game starts, show the bombs
  for 5 seconds or so; then hide them. If the player reveals a bomb, the
  game ends. (If you feel this is too harsh, perhaps you can implement
  "lives" or "hit points"). You might also want to determine the bomb
  count as a function of board size.
- We've already got a working "Match 2" puzzle. What about a "Match 3"
  or "Match 4"? Generalize your code to work for any number of matching
  cards.
