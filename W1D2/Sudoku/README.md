# Sudoku

If you're not familiar with Sudoku, please review the [Wikipedia
page][sudoku-wiki] on the subject.

Provided for you [here][puzzles-zip] are some Sudoku puzzles in .txt
format. Download these to a folder on your computer. In the same folder,
we're going to write a Ruby program to read in the puzzle files and let
us solve them!

## Learning Goals

* Understand what factory methods are and how to use them
* Understand how classes interact and how to use `require_relative`
* Be able to write and explain how bracket methods `[]` and `[]=` work
* Be able to use pry to test small parts of your code

### Tile

Let's implement a Tile class to represent each position on the Sudoku
board. Each Tile has a **value** and is either **given** or not. You can
change the value of any Tile unless it was given (that would be
cheating!) The game would be incredibly frustrating if we didn't have
some way to distinguish given Tiles from non-givens. You'll want to
account for this when writing the `Tile#to_s` method. If you haven't
already, check out the [colorize gem][colorize]!

### Board

A Board should store a `grid` of Tiles. Define your `Board#initialize`
method to accept such a grid as an argument. Since our puzzles exist as
text files, let's write a `Board::from_file` **factory method** to read
a file and parse it into a two-dimensional Array containing Tile
instances.

The Board class will be doing much of the heavy lifting for our game's
logic. It will need the following methods:

- A method to update the value of a Tile at the given `position`
- A `render` method to display the current board state
- A `solved?` method to let us know if the game is over
  - I used several helper methods here. You will want to know if each
    row, column, and 3x3 square has been solved.

### Game

The Game should have an instance variable for the Board. It should also
have methods for managing the Board-Player interaction. You may want a
`play` loop that runs until the puzzle is `solved`. Inside the loop, you
should `render` the board, `prompt` the player for input, and then get
both a `pos` and a `value` from the player. It should then update the
tile at `pos` with the new `value`. I wrote helper methods to get and
validate input from the user; this should help keep our program from
crashing. :)

### Bonus
NB: You should finish the day's remaining projects before going on to the bonus

- You've written a Sudoku **checker**; now write a Sudoku **solver**.
  This is a harder problem, but there are [several
  approaches][solver-algorithms] you might take. As part of your
  approach, you may want to implement a separate Solver class, as well
  as a modified Tile class that keeps track of any previously-guessed
  `value`s.
