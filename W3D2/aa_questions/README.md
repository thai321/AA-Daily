# Question Pairs

**Read the entire project description before beginning**.

Today, we're going to build an application that will help us handle questions from students.  To do this, we will set up the database and then overlay Ruby code to map the data from the database into Ruby objects in memory that we can work with. Our database queries (written in SQL) will live within our Ruby code.

## Learning Goals

* Know how to use a SQL script to construct a database
    * Be able to debug SQL syntax errors
* Be able to use queries, written in SQL, in your Ruby code
* Know how a basic ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system works
* Be able to write SQL queries to solve problems without using Ruby code
    * Be able to use joins instead of Ruby code
    * Be able to use `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` instead of Ruby code

## SQL

We'll first construct a series of tables. Write the table definitions
in a SQL script named `import_db.sql`.

* Add a `users` table.
    * Should track `fname` and `lname` attributes.
* Add a `questions` table.
    * Track the `title`, the `body`, and the associated author
    (a foreign key).
* Add a `question_follows` table.
    * This should support the many-to-many relationship between
    `questions` and `users` (a user can have many questions she
    is following, and a question can have many followers).
    * This is an example of a ***join table***; the rows in
    `question_follows` are used to join `users` to `questions`
    and vice versa.
* Add a `replies` table.
    * Each reply should contain a reference to the subject question.
    * Each reply should have a reference to its parent reply.
    * Each reply should have a reference to the user who wrote it.
    * Don't forget to keep track of the `body` of a reply.
    * "Top level" replies don't have any parent, but all replies have
      a subject question.
    * It's okay for a column to be **self referential**; a foreign key
      can point to a primary key in the same table.
* Add a `question_likes` table.
    * Users can like a question.
    * Have references to the user and the question in this table

You will probably also want to write some `INSERT` statements at the
bottom of your `import_db.sql` file, so that you have some data in
each table to play with. We call this '*seeding the database*'.

After you've written the SQL, don't forget to run the SQL commands and
create the db - in terminal, run:

```SQL
cat import_db.sql | sqlite3 questions.db
```

Now go into your shiny, new sqlite database and try making
some basic queries to ensure that seeding proceeded as planned.
Use `sqlite3 questions.db` to open the sqlite3 console with *questions.db* loaded.

## Gemfile

We're going to be using the sqlite3 gem for this project, so we'll
need to create a gemfile to include it. Start by initting bundler:

```bash
bundle init
```

This will create a starter `Gemfile`. Open it up and add a line to
include the `sqlite3` gem:

```ruby
gem 'sqlite3'
```

Finally, run `bundle install` to install `sqlite3`. This gem will now
be available when you run `pry`.

## Ruby

Keep a tab open with the sqlite3 gem's [documentation][sqlite3-docs]. Use these
docs to help you figure out what methods are available and how to use them!

Write a `QuestionsDatabase` class similar to one created in last night's demo:
[PlaysDatabase][plays.rb]. This class should inherit from `SQLite3::Database`;
you will only need one instance. If you use the Singleton module this will be
available through a `QuestionsDatabase::instance` method.

[plays.rb]: https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum/blob/master/sql/homeworks/plays/solution/plays.rb

*NB: Remember that a singleton is a general programming pattern that describes a
scenario in which you will only have a single instance of a particular
class. Ruby's [Singleton module][ruby-singleton] helps implement this
pattern - it ensures that only one instance of that class is ever
created (make sure you use the `instance` method.)*

[ruby-singleton]: http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/singleton/rdoc/Singleton.html

The `QuestionsDatabase` class will handle the connection to the
database, but when we query the database, we get back a hash of data.
That can be a bit ugly to work with, especially when dealing with
multiple tables.

What we'll do to make this easier on ourselves is abstract away the
communication to each of those tables into objects. We'll create a
**model** class for each table that will represent an item from each
of the tables and abstract away the SQL queries. This will give us an
object-oriented way to interact with the database.

*NB: This pattern of abstracting away data storage and manipulation is
a common one and an extremely helpful one. We will become much more
experienced with this pattern as we transition into Rails.*

* Write one class per table (for the `questions` table we write a
  `Question` class).
* For each class, add a class method `find_by_id` which will lookup an
  `id` in the table, and return an *object* representing that row. For
  example, our `Question::find_by_id` should return an **instance** of
  our `Question` class **NOT** the data hash returned by the
  `QuestionsDatabase`! Your `::find_by_id` method should contain
  `Question.new` somewhere.
    * We'll add additional query class methods as needed. For
      instance, the user class will have `User::find_by_name(fname,
      lname)`.
* Your `initialize` method should take an options hash of attributes and
  construct an object **wrapping** that data. We do this because the
  DB query return value is an array of hashes in exactly this format.
    * E.g., `User.new('fname' => 'Ned', 'lname' => 'Ruggeri',
      'is_instructor' => true)` should return a `User` object with
      those attributes.
* Add attribute accessors to access the instance variables of our new
   classes.  These instance variables have now been populated with the
   data from the database.
    * E.g., `User#fname` will return the `fname` of the user object
         that was populated from a row in the `users` database.

Before writing any more code, take some time to make sure what you've
done so far works by jumping into pry. Load the files you want to test
and call your new methods. Check that your queries return the
correct results and that those results are Ruby objects.

## Queries

Each query method should return *objects* of the appropriate type. For
instance, `user.authored_questions` should return an `Array` of
`Question` objects.

### Easy

None of these involve joins.

* `Question::find_by_author_id(author_id)`
* `Reply::find_by_user_id(user_id)`
* `Reply::find_by_question_id(question_id)`
    * All replies to the question at any depth.
* `User::find_by_name(fname, lname)`
* `User#authored_questions` (use `Question::find_by_author_id`)
* `User#authored_replies` (use `Reply::find_by_user_id`)
* `Question#author`
* `Question#replies` (use `Reply::find_by_question_id`)
* `Reply#author`
* `Reply#question`
* `Reply#parent_reply`
* `Reply#child_replies`
    * Only do child replies one-deep; don't find grandchild comments.

Test out your newly written queries in the console.
Don't move on until you have everything working.

### Medium

All of these involve joins. Refer back to the [joins reading][joins-reading]
to clarify your understanding of joins.

[joins-reading]: https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/

* `QuestionFollow::followers_for_question_id(question_id)`
    * This will return an array of `User` objects!
* `QuestionFollow::followed_questions_for_user_id(user_id)`
    * Returns an array of `Question` objects.
* `User#followed_questions`
    * One-liner calling `QuestionFollow` method.
* `Question#followers`
    * One-liner calling `QuestionFollow` method.

Again, test your queries in the console before moving on.

### Hard

These involve `GROUP BY` and `ORDER`. **Use `JOIN`s to solve these, do
not use Ruby iteration methods**.

* `QuestionFollow::most_followed_questions(n)`
    * Fetches the `n` most followed questions.
* `Question::most_followed(n)`
    * Simple call to `QuestionFollow`

If you haven't already, add a `QuestionLike` class to use your join
table `question_likes`.  Some easy queries:

* `QuestionLike::likers_for_question_id(question_id)`
* `QuestionLike::num_likes_for_question_id(question_id)`
    * Don't just use `QuestionLike::likers_for_question_id` and count;
      do a SQL query to just do this.
    * This is more efficient, since the SQL DB will return just the
      number, and not the data for each of the likes.
* `QuestionLike::liked_questions_for_user_id(user_id)`

These instance methods are one-liners with the above:

* `Question#likers`
* `Question#num_likes`
* `User#liked_questions`

And some harder queries with likes:

* `QuestionLike::most_liked_questions(n)`
* `Question::most_liked(n)`
    * Fetches `n` most liked questions.
* `User#average_karma`
    * Avg number of likes for a `User`'s questions.

Average Karma is pretty tough. Here are some hints:

First, write a single query that returns two things: the number of
questions asked by a user and the number of likes on those questions.

* I used a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` to combine the `questions` and
  `question_likes` table.
    * You need `questions` so you can filter by the author, and you
      need `question_likes` so you can count the number of likes.
* I used a `COUNT(DISTINCT(...))` to count the number of questions.
    * Note that a question that is liked multiple times will be
      repeated in the joined table.
* I used a `COUNT(column)` to count the number of non-`NULL` entries
  in a column.
    * Note that a question that is never liked will take up one row in
      the joined table. How do we use `COUNT(column)` to not count
      this toward the total number of likes?

Next, divide the number of likes by the number of questions. Because
`COUNT` returns two integers, and because integer division rounds down
(`3 / 2 == 1`), we need to `CAST` one of the numbers to `FLOAT`. We
can do this like so: `CAST(value AS FLOAT)`.

Test your queries before moving on to the next phase.

## Updating/saving records

So far we haven't created any new records; we've only been parsing
data fetched from the database and performing queries.

Let's see how to create a new object. Let's add a `#save` method to
our models (`User`, `Question` and `Reply` are enough to get the
point). If the model has not been saved (its `id` attribute is `nil`),
we should perform an `INSERT` of the record's fields into the
DB. After the insert, we can use
`SQLite3::Database#last_insert_row_id` to get the newly issued `id`
for the inserted row. Save this in an `@id` instance variable in your
object. Future calls to `#save` on this object should issue an
`UPDATE`.

If a model already exists in the DB, it should have a non-nil `id`
attribute. Calls to `#save` should issue an `UPDATE` SQL command for
the row with the object's id. Update all the columns with the current
version of the values in your object.

The user should be able to get and set the attributes on the object
you hand them through reader and writer methods (`attr_accessor`).

## Bonus I

### ModelBase class

So you've probably noticed that each of these classes shares a lot of
functionality. Let's extract some common methods out into a superclass.
Easy stuff first, let's take `::find_by_id` out of the individual classes
and put it into our superclass. Let's also add a `::all` method while we're
at it.

Now for the fun part. Your `#save` method is very similar in each
model.  Let's refactor that out into the base class as well.

Hint: you can use `Object#instance_variables` method to get a list of
instance variable names that represent columns.

For the purposes of this project it's necessary to interpolate the name
of the table directly into your SQL queries (ie `#{table}` vs  `?`).
The sqlite3 gem does not support the `?` interpolation for table names.
In this case, we don't need to worry about SQL injection on table
names but still need to sanitize our `WHERE` values. How are these
interpolated values different and why is one safe while the other is not?

### `where`

Add a class method `where` which accepts an options hash as an argument
and searches the database for records whose column matches the options key
and whose value matches the options value. It should return all the records
which match the criteria:

```ruby
Question.where({author_id: 2})
User.where({fname: "Tywin", lname: "Lannister"})
```
Add this to your base class.

### `method_missing` and `find_by`

[See Method Missing reading from prepwork.][method-missing]

Using `method_missing`, implement a dynamic `find_by` which allows users to
find records with any number of arguments. Let's see an example:

```ruby
User.find_by_lname_and_fname("Oberyn", "Martell")
Question.find_by_title("Who is Jon Snow's mother?")
Reply.find_by_question_id_and_author_id(3, 1)
```

[method-missing]: https://github.com/appacademy/appacademy-prep/blob/master/w3/w3d1/readings/method-missing.md

### Improve your `where`

Allow `where` to also accept a string fragment. The string fragment will
be used to directly define the 'WHERE' statement in the SQL query:

```ruby
User.where("lname = 'Stark'")
Question.where("title LIKE '%Who%' AND title LIKE '%Arstan Whitebeard%'")
```

### Write specs for your queries

Go back and write specs for your queries using your rspec knowledge from W2D3. If
you need a refresher on rspec refer to [the readings for that day][rspec-readings].

[rspec-readings]: https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum/blob/master/ruby/README.md#w2d3

Apart from testing that your queries return the correct information, also test that they
hit the database the correct number of times. Also test that methods call queries written
in other classes.

Then write tests for your save and update methods. Think of a way to reset the
database after specs are run to ensure that your test data doesn't persist to the database.
