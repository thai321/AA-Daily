## Wacky Painter Project!

### Overview

This project has a series of small jQuery challenges to be completed
in the `js/view.js` file.

You will write code in methods with names like `View.prototype.exercise3` and
test the effect of your code by clicking a button on the browser with text like
`Exercise 3`.

After testing a method, you will **reset the grid by refreshing the page**.

### Getting Started

Download **[the skeleton][wacky-zip]**.

Use webpack to bundle the js. The webpack config file
has already been set up for you, so you should be able to just run
`webpack --watch`.

After starting webpack, open `index.html` in your browser. The grid and buttons
should be displayed.

### Doing the Exercises

There are several buttons above a grid. These correspond to the
`View.prototype.exerciseX` methods defined in `view.js`. You will write code
within these methods to solve the challenges described in the comments. You
**will not need to change any code anywhere else** except within the `exerciseX`
methods.

Once you write the code to solve the exercise, clicking the button will run
the code you wrote. After running an exercise,
**refresh the page to reset the grid**.

The first exercise, `exercise0` has been completed for you. Click the button
`exercise 0` to see its effect.

Complete the challenges in order.

### Have fun!
