# Vanilla DOM Manipulation

Today we're going to practice manipulating the DOM without using jQuery -- only vanilla JavaScript for us! Let's get started.

Download the skeleton [zip file][zip], and check out the index file that's already been set up for you. You'll be writing the `script.js` file to manipulate that index page. Just open `index.html` in the browser and keep refreshing as you make changes.

As you will notice, only one of the interactive features is working. We can cross restaurants off the list, but we can't add SF places of our own to visit or add more photos of cute puppies. Time to employ some more JavaScript!

### Phase I: Crossing off list items

This one has been done for you. Let's walk through it as an example.

In the `script.js` file, notice that all of our DOM manipulation code has been wrapped in an event listener. Can you think why this is necessary? (Hint: check out where the script tag is located in the HTML document).

With that set up, we are free to write our JavaScript code directly in the event listener's callback. No need to declare classes, constructors, etc. -- we're just writing stand-alone code that will be executed as soon as the DOM is loaded.

First, we declare a function `toggleLi` that takes in an `event`. Using that event, we grab the `currentTarget` (which is the `<li>` that was clicked on) and toggle its `className` to be either `visited` or `""`. Over in our CSS file, the class `.visited` is set to have `line-through` its text. Because of this, all we have to do to toggle the strikethrough appearance of the text is toggle the `<li>`'s class to `visited` or not.

### Phase II: Adding list items

This one's a little trickier. We want to make it so that users can input a place, click the submit button, and have the input box clear out & the new item appended to the list. This is, in fact, almost exactly what one of the examples in the [DOM reading][dom-reading] does. Check it out for guidance. Remember to use the class names and IDs already set up in the HTML document!

### Phase III: Adding your own photos

Finally, update the last section to allow users to add their own photos of cute puppies. Clicking the "Toggle new photo form" button should show or hide the form to add a photo. When submitted, the form should then append a new list item containing an `<img>` tag to the bottom of the puppy list. Because of the styling already set, the photos should appear side by side. Don't forget that you're appending an `<li>` that contains an `<img>` tag to the `<ul>`. You should do this in multiple steps! Hint: what property do we want to set on the new `<img>` tag once we've created it?

Once you're done, compare with the [solution][solution].
