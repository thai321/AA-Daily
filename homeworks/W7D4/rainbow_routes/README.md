# Rainbow Routes

Today we're going to get our first experience using React Router. The
goal is to create a basic app that displays the colors of the rainbow.
This rainbow, however, has something special about it - some of the
colors are nested within others.

## Phase 0: Setup

Download the [zip file][zip-skeleton] of the skeleton. Poke around to
get familiar with the setup; it should look pretty familiar. Run `npm
install` to get it setup. Then run `npm start` to start `webpack --watch`.

Open `index.html` in your browser and verify you can
see the "Rainbow Router" header.  Currently there is no functionality.
Let's fix that!

## Phase 1: Routes

First take a look at the entry file `entry.jsx`. Note that in the `Root`
component we have wrapped the `Rainbow` component in `<HashRouter>`
tags. This will make the router available to all any descendent React
Router components such as `<Route />` and `<Link />`. Don't change the
entry file - everything is already set up for you.

Now open the file `components/rainbow.jsx`. We're going to render some
of our color components from here. Ultimately we want our routes to look
like this.

URL                     | Components
------------------------|-----------
`/`                     | `Rainbow`
`/red`                  | `Rainbow -> Red`
`/red/orange`           | `Rainbow -> Red -> Orange`
`/red/yellow`           | `Rainbow -> Red -> Yellow`
`/green`                | `Rainbow -> Green`
`/blue`                 | `Rainbow -> Blue`
`/blue/indigo`          | `Rainbow -> Blue -> Indigo`
`/violet`               | `Rainbow -> Violet`

This means that the `Red`, `Green`, `Blue`, and `Violet` components need
to render in the `Rainbow` component, but only when we are at the
corresponding URL. We'll do this with `Route` components. (Refer back to
the [reading][intro] for details.) Add the necessary `Route` components
inside the `div` with `id="rainbow"` in the `Rainbow#render` method. For
example, to render the `Red` component you will want

```jsx
  <Route path="/red" component={Red} />
```

Test that your code works!  Manually type in each URL we just created,
and you should see the color component pop up.  Remember, these are
React Routes, so the paths we created will come after the `#`.  For
example, our red route will look like `<some-local-path>/skeleton/index.html/#/red`.

We want to nest the `Orange` and `Yellow` components inside the `Red`
component, and the `Indigo` component inside the `Blue` component.
You'll have to go add the corresponding `Route` tags to the `red.jsx`
and `blue.jsx` files. Make sure to use the correct nested paths, such as
`"/red/orange"` for the orange `Route`.

## Phase 2: Links

Manually navigating to our newly created routes is tiresome, so let's
add functionality to take care of this process for us. React Router
provides the Link component for this purpose.

Add links to the paths `/red`, `/green`, `/blue`, and `/violet` in the
`Rainbow` component. For example, your red link should look like

```jsx
<Link to='/red' >Red</Link>
```

When we are at `blue` we want to be able to get to `/blue/indigo`, and
then back to `/blue`. Add the corresponding `Link`s to the `Blue`
component like this:

```jsx
<Link to='/blue' >Blue only</Link>
<Link to='/blue/indigo' >Add indigo</Link>
```

 Similarly, add `Link`s to `/red`, `/red/orange` and
`/red/yellow` to the `Red` component. Test all your links. Navigation is
so much easier now!

## Phase 3: NavLinks

It would be nice if our links gave us some indication of which route we
were at. Fortunately, React Router has a special component for that very
purpose: `NavLink`. NavLinks get an extra CSS class when their `to` prop
matches the current URL. By default this class is called `active`.

Go ahead and switch all your `Link`s to `NavLink`s. If you open the app
you won't see any change yet. That's because we haven't added any
special styling to the `active` class. Go ahead and open the
`application.css` file. Find the `.active` class and add the line
`font-weight: 700`. Now your active links will be bold. Isn't that nice!

The only problem is that now the `Blue only` link is active even when
the path is `/blue/indigo`. That doesn't make a lot of sense. Let's add
the `exact` flag to that link so it will only be active when its `to`
exactly matches the current path. Now it should look like:

```jsx
<NavLink exact to='/blue' >Blue only</NavLink>
```

Do the same for the `Red only` link. Everything should be working now.

Compare your work to the solution and make sure the behavior is the
same. Time to celebrate! :tada: :rainbow: :tada:
