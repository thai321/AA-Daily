# Controllers

Today's homework is going to focus on controllers.

**Things to know for this homework:**

* Views are a new concept that you will be learning about in greater
detail during tomorrow's homework. For now, just know that they have
access to instance variables defined by the corresponding controller
action (e.g. the books' `index` view has access to instance variables
defined in `BooksController#index`) and are what we actually see on the
page.
* In the videos/readings on controllers so far, we have seen them `render
:json`; for this assignment, we will be rendering templates instead. For
example, to render the `index`, we simply `render :index`. To redirect
to the index, we `redirect_to` the url that matches our intended route
when we `rails routes` â€“ in this case, the `books_url`.

A basic rails project has already been made for you - except for the
controllers. Download the [skeleton zip][skeleton]. To set up, navigate
into the project directory and run:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rails db:setup
rails s
```

Now we have some basic data and our server is running and ready to take requests.

### Index and Destroy

The app has a basic library of books. Right now, we only have routes to
see the list of all books (`:index`) and delete (`:destroy`) whichever
books we like; we can see that these are the only options available to
us by checking our `routes.rb` file in the `config` folder:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :books, only: [:index, :destroy]
end
```

Check those out by navigating to `localhost:3000/books`. Whoops! We get this error:

![image of index error](index_error.png)

Our books' `index` view is expecting there to be a `@books` variable
that contains all the books from the database, but it's currently `nil`.
This is a job for our controller's `index` action! Get your index
working so that `@books` is correctly set to all books and we can see
our library's index page.

Now we can see our awesome library of books, but how about deleting
them? Try one of those delete buttons and you'll notice another error:
`Missing template`. Rails is automatically searching for our `destroy`
template. But we actually don't need one! We don't want to render a
delete page -- we just want to update the index page so that our deleted
book is no longer showing.

When we hit the 'delete' button, it hits our controller's `destroy`
action. Using ActiveRecord, find the book in question, delete it, and
`redirect_to` the index page. This redirect will override the default
search for a `destroy` template. **Hint:** the controller has access to
the `params` that are passed through as part of the request. Because we
have the `binding_of_caller` and `better_errors` gems installed (as part
of the gemfile), you can throw a `fail` in to your `destroy` action, try
to delete a book, and use the console that appears in the browser to see
exactly what the `params` look like. What param will we use to find the
correct book in our ActiveRecord query?

### New and Create

Delete some books. You'll notice that our library is shrinking, but
there's no way to add new books to our collection (that 'add a book'
link down at the bottom isn't working!). Let's add that functionality.
To do this, we need corresponding routes that will 1) give us the form
to add a book (already made for you!) and 2) save that new book to the
database (`:new` and `:create`, respectively). Let's update our
`routes.rb` file to reflect this. It should look like this:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :books, only: [:new, :create, :index, :destroy]
end
```

Now we can check our existing routes by running `bundle exec rake
routes` in the terminal. We have these `:new` and `:create` routes now,
and they are expecting the corresponding controller actions to work
properly when we navigate to them. Let's finish up by writing those
`new` and `create` controller actions! The `new` action's job is just to
render the page with the form to add a book; `create` is what will
actually save that new book with the parameters we give it to the database.

Hints:
* the `new` template has already been made for you and is located at
`app/views/books/new.html.erb`
* the `create` action needs to `redirect_to` the `index` page if we want
to see our new book added to the library
* you can hit the `:new` route by either clicking on the 'Add a book!'
link or navigating directly to `localhost:3000/books/new`
* our `create` action has access to the values submitted through the new
book form via the private `book_params` method provided for you in the
`BooksController`
