# CSS Warm Up

We're going to take our first steps using CSS! In this assignment we'll build a pixel perfect clone of [this page][live-04].

Often when working as a front-end developer you'll be collaborating with a designer. Most likely they will provide you with a sequence of screenshots and specifications for you to convert into neatly, maintainable HTML and CSS.

To guide you there will be hints broken out in phases, a series of [screenshots][shots] and a document with [specifications][specs]. I'd also like you to take a look a the [exploded view][exploded] to get a good sense of the structure and nesting of elements.

As your first step towards CSS mastery, this assignment will focus on getting comfortable with CSS properties. A semantic HTML document, as well as stylesheets with CSS selectors have already been crafted for you. You get to do the fun part of applying styles!

We will use the following subset of [CSS 2.1][css-21] properties. With only these 11 properties we can style the complete page!

1. [display][p-display]
2. [margin][p-margin]
3. [border][p-border] (and border-bottom, border-left, etc.)
4. [padding][p-padding]
5. [width][p-width]
6. [font-family][p-font-family]
7. [font-size][p-font-size]
8. [font-weight][p-font-weight]
9. [color][p-color]
10. [background][p-background]
11. [float][p-float]

## A Few Tips Before You Start...

- Make sure to keep the [specs][specs] at your side at all time.
- Open the [screenshots][shots] in Apple's Preview to study them. You get a nice crosshair to select and measure elements. You can also zoom.
- Use Chrome and the [inspector tools][inspector] (command-option-i). Make sure not to accidentally be zoomed in on your page. The screenshots and browser ratio should be 1:1.
- You will be working in the **skeleton** directory. Each phase corresponds to a numbered CSS file you should use, as well as an HTML file.
- The best way to see how properties modify the layout is to quickly try something, and then view the result in the browser. Try to make small iterative steps, getting immediate feedback from your browser.
- Finally, enjoy the beauty in the details. A designer's favorite game is Spot The Difference. So-so approximations never suffice, and they will kindly let you know.
- You can do it!

## Phase 1: Header

- [Screenshot A][ss-01-a]
- [Live][live-01]

Every browser comes with a built in stylesheet. This is called the `user-agent-stylesheet`. As browsers vary, and we don't want to be fighting built in styles, we've provided a so-called reset stylesheet. This is automatically included in your HTML documents today. If you're curious, you can peek at `skeleton/css/00-reset.css`. We'll talk more about this later in class this week.

OK. Let's dive into it! Open up the first screenshot and see our goal. You will write your CSS in `skeleton/css/01-header.css`. Pull up the HTML file in `skeleton/01-header.html` and study the markup. Also view it in the browser.

The best place to start is typography. Let's crack open the [specs][specs] and set the corresponding values for `font-family`, `font-size`, and `font-weight`. We set these properties on the `body` selector in the provided CSS file. Setting them on the `body` element will cause them to nicely trickle down to all other elements. Refresh and give a yay for `sans-serif`!

The next thing we'll note about the screenshot is that the background of the entire page is a light gray. Look up the hexidecimal color code for a light gray in the [specs][specs]. Add the `background` property to the `body` selector. Refresh the page and see the change!

**Note:** Setting temporary background colors on elements is an excellent way to debug your CSS. This helps you understand what rectangle you are working with. I like to use built in color names to quickly do this. Using `background: yellow;` or `background: green;` is quick and easy. Most crayon colors are supported as keywords.

The next step to is to focus on the header bar. Let's make it red. Add the appropriate property and value to the `.header` class. Refresh. Notice a thin gray line below the bar. Go add it using `border-bottom`.

Next up, as we see in the HTML and can discern from the screenshot, there is an inner element inside the `.header` element. It is less wide than the whole header, which expands to the full width of the browser. Look at the [specs][specs] to see the desired width of the container and set the `width` property for the `.header-nav` element. Refresh. Note that there's no easy way to see if this had the desired effect, as elements are transparent by default (we dictated this in the provided reset stylesheet). So let's give the `.header-nav` a temporary background color. How about green? Refresh. What do you see?

So it's the right size, but it's aligned to the left. All block elements behave this way by default. Rather, we would like it to be centered. Somewhat unintuitive, we center block elements by giving them a `margin: auto` property. This will evenly space out the margins on the left and right side of an element. Note that this only works if the element is less wide than its parent element, else there would be no remaining space to evenly divide. Refresh and enjoy!

Almost there! Let's set left and right gray borders on the `.header-nav` and get rid of the temporary green background color. Let's also set the `color` property on the `.header` to make all the text white. So close!

Finally, we note that our header is quite thin compared to the screenshot. There needs to be more space around the words of "App Academy Friends". We have several options with CSS to fix this, adding padding or margin to either the `header`, `nav`, `h1`, or `a` elements would do the trick. However, I'd argue that from a usability standpoint it would make sense to make our click targets as large as possible. So let's add `padding` to all links nested in the `.header`. Padding, however, only plays nicely on block elements. By default `<a>` tags are inline elements, as they nicely flow as words in a paragraph. Let's use our CSS powers to override this default, by setting  `display: block;`, together with the padding on all `.header a` elements.

Refresh and high-five yourself!

## Phase 2: Navigation

- [Screenshot A][ss-02-a]
- [Screenshot B][ss-02-b]
- [Live][live-02]

Let's add some navigation! Pull up the screenshot and study the HTML for this phase. Note that we've been given a nicely structured unordered list `<ul>` with list items `<li>` inside of it, who in their turn contain `<a>` tags. Note how we declared the corresponding CSS selectors for all these tags.

Since we added a general rule to make all `a` tags inside of the `.header` to be block elements and have padding, our newly added `<a>` tags nicely pick up this style too.

The big challenge of this phase will be to get a bunch of `block` elements next to each other horizontally. As you might recall, block elements do not tolerate any neighbors by default. However, we'd like the `h1` to be on the left, and the `ul` on the right. Inside the `ul`, we'd like all `li`'s to be next to each other too.

We can accomplish this using a property called `float`. There's a lot to say about floating, and we'll go more in depth on it soon in class. For now it's enough to know that you can set the `float` property to either `left`, `right`, or `none`. In short it will cause an element to float on the right or left, causing any content below it to move up and wrap around it.

Let's see it in action. Set `float: left;` on `.header-logo` and `float: right;` on `.header-list`. Refresh the page and observe. Note that the red header completely disappeared, but `.header-logo` and `.header-list` are still there on the left and the right in faint white. This is sort of what we want, but it's also broken. We'll talk more about this crazy behavior in class.

For now, the thing to memorize is that **whenever we float any element, we have to add the `.group` clearfix class to the parent element in our HTML.** This is a little snippet of CSS we provided as an utility in the reset stylesheet. Open up the `skeleton/02-navigation.html` file and add `group` to the class list of the `<nav>` tag, causing it look like `<nav class="header-nav group">`. Refresh and our red header should reappear. Yay!

Let's use this same trick to get the `li` elements next to each other horizontally. Add `float: left;` rule to the `.header-list > li` selector. Make sure to add the group class to the `<ul>` tags. Great!

Next up, add some borders. We'd like a line on the right side of the `.header-logo`. We'd also like a line on the left side of all `.header-list > li` elements. Let's also set the `font-weight` on the `.header-logo` to make it bold.

Finally, to top it off, let's consider the usability of our navigation bar. Wouldn't it be great to give some visual feedback that you can click on links? Sure, we're given a little pointer hand as a cursor when we hover over any `<a>` tag. But let's go the extra mile and have it change its background color to black. We can employ the `:hover` psuedo-selector to accomplish this. Use the `.header-logo:hover` and `.header-list > li:hover` to set the `background` property. Neat, not?

At this point we've covered all basic techniques. Yay! The next two steps will simply be variations of what we've done so far!

## Phase 3: Content

- [Screenshot A][ss-03-a]
- [Live][live-03]

Launch the HTML file in Chrome and notice the big mess and broken navigation bar. Don't be discouraged, it's simply the missing `group` classes from the HTML. Add them back to the HTML like we did earlier. Much better!

Let's study the screenshots. We need a white background on the `.content` container. We also need to constrain its width. Next we need to center it (hint: margin!). Let's also add borders to its left, right and bottom sides.

Inside the `.content` container we have two child elements: `.content-sidebar` and `.content-main`. If we look in the specs we see their widths defined. Go ahead and set them. Next we'd like to have them be next to each other. Use the `float: left` property on both elements. Don't forget to set the group class on their parent `.content`. Refresh.

That looks good. However, we'd like some whitespace to allow our text to breathe. Again we have several options to use margin or padding to accomplish this. I'd suggest setting padding on both `.content-sidebar` and `.content-main`. Note though that padding increases an element's total width. Therefore you're going to have to subtract any padding off the previously defined width to make it all fit. Give it a shot.

Finally, set the `font-size` and `font-weight` on the `.content h1`. Add a bottom margin to the header to allow some space between it and the paragraph below.

So close!

## Phase 4: Footer

- [Screenshot A][ss-04-a]
- [Screenshot B][ss-04-b]
- [Live][live-04]

At this point you should be able to tackle the footer mostly on your own. I'd suggest giving it a shot! Remember the [specs][specs].

If you get stuck, here's the list of steps I'd take: Set the width and the background, align the footer center, set the color and font-size and add the borders. Float the copyright to the left, and the list of links to the right. Have the inner list items be floated to the left. Don't forget to add the group classes to all parents of a floated element. Use padding to space everything out. Finally, set a hover state for the links. Et voila!

You did it! Pretty cool, right? Now compare your work to my solutions!
