Oh no! We've removed the original reset stylesheet! Time to build our own. :sunglasses:

1. Clear default margin, padding and border from any elements that we're using in our HTML.
2. Make sure font properties get inherited.
3. Remove default styling from lists.
4. Give text in the body a line-height of 1.5.
5. Make sure images always take up the width of their parents.


Compare your recipe page to [this example](./solution/example.html) and [this stylesheet](./solution/assets/css_reset.css).
