- Less structured, but generally: work time mornings, lectures/mock interviewing, Algorithms projects

### Job Search Strike System
- Coding Curriculum strikes are reased as of now
- 5 strikes = tuition -> flat fee/removal from job search support.
- Strikeable tings: missing roll call, not returning emails, not meeting application quotas, not meeting deadlines, incomplete projects, not passing specs on algorithms projects.
- Every Friday, strike count reduces by 1
- **Designed to keep you on track & get you employed. This is just a system of accountability. Remember, our incentives are all aligned; we want to help you get a job as software develper!**


### JavaScript Projects

#### Why a JS Project?
- Almost every employer uses JS in some form
- A JS project can show off your object-oriented programming skills
- You can make something really pretty with JS/CSS (recruiters love pretty stuff!)
- Supplements your FSP as another coding example.


### JS project Requirements
- No tutorials or overuse of Libraries. Do your research and justify your choices.
- Can be a game, but something original is best
- Can be a data visualization project!
- Choose something with an appropriate scope (you'll hhave mornings and evenings over 4 days to complete it)
- Must show off front-end skills -- make it pretty

- You will be basically on your own. That is on purpose; in the real world you have to learn a lot on your own.
- Your TAs and Job Coaches are here to support you, but you must show independence and self-direction.
- You will rise to the occasion!!!
