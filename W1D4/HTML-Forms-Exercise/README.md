## HTML Forms Exercise

**N.B.** Remember that forms make a request upon submission to the provided action URI. Since we don't have a server to handle the request, our form won't really do anything on submission. Still, this exercise will help practice coding the structure of our form element.

Take [yesterday's solution][prev-solution] from HTML Containers Exercise and add a review form:

1. Make a `section` element before your footer and after the directions section
2. Create a `form` element in the section
2. Inside the `form` element make a `label` and text `input` for the name of the reviewer. Use the 'for' and 'id' attributes to link the label to the input.
3. Create a label for "Rating" and 5 radio inputs with corresponding value attributes. Have the radio buttons default to checking '1'.
4. Create a "Cooking Expertise" label that corresponds to a `select` element containing 5 `option` elements, don't forget their value attributes:
    - Select Cooking Expertise (make this disabled and selected by default)
    - Sometimes Cook
    - Cook Everyday
    - Cooking is a Hobby
    - Professional Chef
5. Code a `label` element for "Review" but this time place the corresponding `textarea` element inside the label element instead of using for/id.

After coding your recipe page, compare your html to [this example][solution].
