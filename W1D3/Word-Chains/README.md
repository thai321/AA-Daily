# Word Chains

Read the [Word Chains RubyQuiz][quiz].

**NB: You shouldn't have to use recursion for this one.**

**NB: Review the entire outline before beginning.**

## Phase I: Adjacent Words

Let's write a class `WordChainer`.

Begin writing the `#initialize(dictionary_file_name)` method. Read in the [dictionary file][dictionary]. Store the array of dictionary words in an instance variable (e.g., `@dictionary`).

Next, write a helper method `adjacent_words(word)`. This should return all words in the dictionary one letter different than the current word. By "one letter different" we mean that both words have the same length and only differ at one position, e.g. "mat" and "cat" count as adjacent words, but "cat" and "cats" do not, nor do "cola" and "cool."

Verify that your `adjacent_words` method is working.

**Hint**: To speed up your search greatly, store your dictionary as a [`Set`][ruby-set]. The `Set#include?` method is much faster than `Array#include?`, since the `Array` version needs to iterate through all the elements of the array, whereas `Set` uses a cool trick we'll learn about when we get to the algorithms curriculum.

## Phase IIa: Exploring all words

Next, let's begin writing a method `#run(source, target)`. Our strategy is:

* Keep a list of `@current_words`. Start this with just `[source]`.

* Also keep a list of `@all_seen_words`. Start this with just `[source]`.

* Begin an outer loop which will run as long as `@current_words` is not empty. This will halt our exploration when all words adjacent to `@current_word` have been discovered.

* Inside this loop, create a new, empty list of `new_current_words`. We're going to fill this up with new words (that aren't in `@all_seen_words`) that are adjacent (one step away) from a word in `@current_words`.

* To fill up `new_current_words`, begin a second, inner loop through `@current_words`.

* For each `current_word`, begin a third loop, iterating through all `adjacent_words(current_word)`. This is a triply nested loop.

* For each `adjacent_word`, skip it if it's already in `@all_seen_words`; we don't need to reconsider a word we've seen before.

* Otherwise, if it's a new word, add it to both `new_current_words`, and `@all_seen_words` so we don't repeat it.

* After we finish looping through all the `@current_words`, print out `new_current_words`, and reset `@current_words` to `new_current_words`.

Make sure your `run` method eventually terminates: it should
eventually enumerate all the words that are reachable from `source`, at which point `new_current_words` will come out empty. After setting `@current_words = new_current_words` the outermost loop should terminate.

After executing `#run`, `@all_seen_words` will contain a list of all the words encountered in our 'exploration.'

Test your word chainer to make sure it outputs (1) first the words that are one letter away from `source`, (2) next words that are one letter away from words one letter away from `source` (i.e., two letters away from source), etc. This is a **breadth first** enumeration of words that you can reach from the `source`.

**Call your TA over to check your work**.

## Phase IIb: Refactor

Your code will contain a triply nested loop. Break out the inner loop that iterates through `@current_words` and builds and assigns the `new_current_words` to its own method: `#explore_current_words`.

## Phase III: Keep Track of Prior Words

So far we've written our program to build a set of `@all_seen_words`, adding new words in breadth-first order. However, we don't record enough information to construct a path of words from the `source` to the `target`.

Let's change our program. For every new word we encounter, let's record which previous word we modified to get to the new word. To do this, instead of keeping an array of `@all_seen_words`, lets make it a hash, where the keys are new words, and the value is the word we modified to get to the new word.

Let's start `@all_seen_words` out as `{ source => nil }`, since `source` didn't come from anywhere. Let's modify `explore_current_words` so that instead of merely adding an `adjacent_word` to the array, we record it as the key, where the value is the `current_word` we came from.

Modify `explore_current_words` to print not just the new words, but where they came from. At the end of `explore_current_words`, iterate through `new_current_words`, and print out the new word and the word it came from (the value in the `@all_seen_words` hash). Make sure this output makes sense. You may want to use a longer word like `"market"` to reduce the verbosity of the output.

## Phase IV: Backtracking

Okay! Right now `#run` builds `@all_seen_words`, but it never constructs the path from the source to the target. Let's use `@all_seen_words` to do this.

Write a method named `#build_path(target)`. It should look up the target in `@all_seen_words`. This is the word we were at before the final step to `target`. Then we need to look up the word we used to get the second to last word. Then the word before that.

Keep looking back and back in from `target` in `@all_seen_words`. Each time, add the prior word to an array named `path`. Eventually you will reach `nil`, which means we've reached the end of the path back to `source`.

Have `#run` call `build_path` and return the array.

**Make sure to request a code review from your TA once you can find
adjacent words**

## Bonus Phase: Stop Early

Your `run` method will build the entire set of reachable words. This is wasteful if the source is close to the target. We can stop early in that case. Modify `run` to stop looping when `@all_seen_words` contains the target.
