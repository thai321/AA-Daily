6. Add another `list-style` of your choosing to all ordered list elements
7. Change the width of the logo image to 100px by selecting all img elements that are immediate children of the header element
  * **Hint:** Use `>`
8. Select all anchor elements within list elements within unordered list elements and remove their underlines. Also change their color to inherit.
9. Give your whole recipe page a nice `background-color`
10. Set the `line-height` to 1.5 in your css_reset file

**Challenge:** Come up with a way to select and style your reviews after they are submitted. For now just some simple font-styling is fine.

Compare your recipe page to [this example](./solution/example.html) and [this stylesheet](./solution/assets/css_syntax.css).
